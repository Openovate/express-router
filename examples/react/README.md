# React Example

## Install

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

In your browser, visit `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` and 
`http://127.0.0.1:3000/product/1` to see what happens.

In this example we use the `resolve` event to transform a callback which is
an object `{ component: Home }` to an actual callback and re-routed into the
router.

We used react as an example and other template engines should be able to
interface with the router in the exact same manner.
